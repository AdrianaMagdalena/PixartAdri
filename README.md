# landing-page

Landing page project

Link to the LIVE webpage: https://adrianamagdalena.github.io/PixartAdri/

Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

Notes:
Header links to facebook and twitter, and banner button "contact me" do not guide anywhere as per design.
There's a separate page for gallery, but the rest of navigation links guide to different sections of the same page.
Only Instagram link on header guides outside of the page (to my social media).

All the pixel art graphics used on the website were created by and are owned by me.
